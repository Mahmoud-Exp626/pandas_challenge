•	Draws two correct conclusions or comparisons from the calculations (10 points)

1. The goal for module 4 challenge was to analyze the district-wide test results for math and reading to showcase trends in the school’s performance. This challenge involved cleaning and organizing data in order to present an easy-to-read dataset. Throughout this challenge, we calculated and created high-level snapshots of the following key metrics into a Data Frame:
•	District Summary
•	School Summary
•	Highest-Performing Schools (by percent overall passing)
•	Lowest-Performing Schools (by percent overall passing)
•	Math Scores by Grade
•	Reading Scores by Grade
•	Scores by School Spending 
•	Scores by School Size
•	Scores by School Type
By performing these tasks, we learned the importance of showing specific data, and how it impacts decision making. 

2. According to the data showcased in the ‘per_school_summary‘ data frame, we can see that Charter schools outperformed District schools in Math and Reading scores, percentage that passed Math and Reading, and Overall passing percentage. In the Data Frame with highest performing Schools, we can see that the top five are Chartered Schools while the bottom five are Districts Schools. 
We also learn from the Data that you do not need to spend a lot of money per student to achieve higher passing scores. Charter schools spends less per student and achieves higher student passing percentages.
